    c. Show the new value of the count twice without creating an object.
    d. Create an object of the Test.
    e. Show the new value of the count twice without creating an object.

Problem-2
1. Create a class named Test.
2. Create a static method named mathUtils which returns the square of given integer.
3. From the main function call the method named mathUtils without creating object.

Problem-3

    b. Create a instance variable named "instaceVar" which stores "I am instance".
    c. Create a public static method named "staticMethod" Which prints "Inside static method" and prints the value stored in staticVar.
    d. Create a public Instance method named "instanceMethod" Which prints "Inside instance method" and prints both values stored in staticVar and instanceVar.
    e. Create a main method.
2. Inside the main method which contains the following:
