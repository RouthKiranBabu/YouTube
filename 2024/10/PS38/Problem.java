/*Problem-1
1. Create the set that stores the String type.
2. Add "Java" and "Python" to the set.
3. Create a iterator for the set.
4. Print all the element present in the set.

Problem-2
1. Create the set that stores the Character type.
2. Add 'A' and 'B' to the set.
3. Print all the elements present in the set.

Theory:
A constructor is present to initialize the variables named Name, isExercising and age.
"this" keyword refers to the current object.

Problem-3
1. Create a class named "employee".
2. Create a instance variable or attributes of a class as fallows:
    a. Name Which is a string type.
    b. isExercising which is a bool type.
    c. age which is a Integer type.
3. Create a Constructor or to initialize the object which takes as follows:
    a. Name Which is a string type.
    b. isExercising which is a bool type.
    c. age which is a Integer type.
4. Apply the constructor taken values to the instance variable using 'this' keyword.
5. Create a method(or to define behavior) named "displayInfo" which shows details of employee.
6. Create a object of a class named "employee" using new keyword followed by a call to the constructor.
7. After creating an object Try to access the method or variable of the object.
