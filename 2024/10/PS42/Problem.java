/*Problem-1(Method-overloading or Compile-Time Polymorphism)
1. Create a class named Calculator.
2. Create a overloaded "add" method with Two int parameters Which adds two parameters and returns the value.
3. Create a overloaded "add" method with three int parameters Which adds three parameters and returns the value.
4. Create a overloaded "add" method with two double parameters Which add two parameters of double type and returns the sum of values.
5. Create the public static void main which contains:
    a. Create a Calculator class.
    b. call add method providing input as 5 and 10.
    c. call add method providing input as 5, 10 and 15.
    d. call add method providing input as 2.5 and 3.5.

Problem-2(Method-overriding or Run-Time Polymorphism)
1. Create a Class named Animal.
2. Class Animal has the Overridden method named "sound" which prints "Animal makes a sound".
3. Create the Dog class which extends to Animal.
4. Class Dog has the Overriding method named "sound" which prints "Dog barks".
5. Create the Cat class which extends to Animal.
6. Class Cat has the Overriding method named "sound" which prints "Cat meows".
7. In the main function which contains the following:
    a. Create an object of super class and sub class like Dog and Cat.
    b. Call Animal sound method.
    c. Call dog sound method.
    d. Call Cat sound method.
