local Storage: is a property that allows javascript sites and apps to save
key-vlaue pairs in a web browser with no expiration date.

when to use the local storage?
you should only use local storage when storing insensitive information.
local storage can help in storing temporary data before it is pushed
to the server.

limitations:
the major limitations of local storage are:
insecure data.
synchronous operations.
limited storage capacity.

in local storage synchronous operations is not possible.
local storage is the mini database or the server it is meant 
in the term of size means images and videos cannot be stored but 
can store the image urls and the videos urls.

to use the local storage in your web applications, there are 
four methods to choose from:
setItem(): add key and value to local storage 
getItem(): this is how you get items from local storage
removeItem(): remove an item by key from local storage 
clear(): clear all local storage

set item has two arguments first item is key and next is value. we 
know the local storage stores the value in form of key value pairs.

local storage stores only strings, boolean and numbers

adding an item to local storage:
syntax:- localStorage.setItem("key", "value")
Note: Both keys and value should be in form of string.

storing a string into localStorage
syntax:
localStorage.setItem('name', "MASAI School");

storing an array or object into localStorage
To store arrays or objects, you would have to first convert them
to strings and then store them in local storage.

JavaScript Object Notation(JSON) is a representation of structured
data based on JavaScript object syntax.

Data is sent and received on Internet in JSON(mostly).
It is basd on Javascript object literals.
used with network requests(AJAX etc).

Thus, JSON can be used to send data from the front-end to the 
back-end, and vice-versa.

Many popular databases like MongoDB, couchDB, MySQL, Oracle and
PostgreSQL also have extensive support for JSON.

Think of JSON as an universal data format on the Internet.

Important notes about JSON:
It's just a data format an does not contain any functions/methods
Even a single misplaced comma can damage the whole file
Only quoted strings can be used as properties

--------------------------------------------------
Conversion between JSON and Js Objects 
client(Monitor) to web server(CPU)/local storage:
convert to JSON strings 
JSON.stringify(obj)

Web server(CPU)/local storage to Client:
Convert back to objects 
JSON.parse(data)
--------------------------------------------------

JSON will become more relevant when we learn about API's 
and retrieving data from them.
