If one person created the repository and this repository must also be used by the teammates 
having 2 to more persons for that:
go to repository settings -> collaborators -> send SMS -> Provide Authentication Code -> add people(By providing GitHub username or email)

the email is sent to them if they accept they get added as the collaborators.

they can create their own new branches and do the same things.

go get the things done by others in separate branch
where I am at some other branch:
git pull origin "branch-name"

or we can pull the main or the master branch by:
git pull origin
