Client Server Model

How do computers talk over the internet?
client and server communications
from (client to server) as request and 
(server to client) as response
client are crome, compass, command prompt 
server like CPU.

general format of a request/response
has header and body

ip address is uniquely identify the computer 
when there is sending response to the 
computer 

the form of the ip address is like:
#.#.#.#
where each # represents the value from 0 to 255
so the combinations will be from 
0.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255
to total combinations will be 255*255*255*255

message will be sent by using the TCP Connection
first: client to server (SYN)
second: server to client (SYN-ACK)
third: client to server(ACK) -> server connection ok

HTTP Request Header Fields:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
method   |   action              |accompanied by content in request body?
---------|-------------------------------------------------------------
GET      |   Indicates that      |No
         |   some data needs     |
         |   to be retrieved     |
POST     |   Submit some content |(the entry that is submitted)
         |   to the path         |
         |   requested.it will   |
         |   either create or    |
         |   update the content  |
             if it already exists|
PUT      |   Replace some        |(the content to be replaced)
         |   content on the      |
         |   path requested      |                 
DELETE   |   Delete some content |(the content to be deleted)
         |   on the path         |
         |   requested           | 

go to the inspect -> Network -> and then refresh the page (or f5).
select the items present in the Name -> Headers in the general where
we have the request method like (POST GET, etc), request URL, 

for the status code: 200 means every thing is ok.
status code: 201 means we have created if we successfully register.
status code: 202 means for Accepted 
status code: 404 means not found
status code: 405 means method not allowed
for 405 status code: method is not allowed for this particular URL 
if we want to create the same methods for different URL is possible
but if we use the post urls for the get or vice versa is not possible 
status code: 408 means request timed out
status code: 500 means internal server Error means there might be 
bugs will be present in the port or at the web server 
status code: 503 means for service unavailable

any website is posted is given in unique address and this address 
is also in form of #.#.#.# if I type Masai school there might be 
some server which might be hosting masai school there might be some 
ip address for that masai school but I do not know the IP address 
of that particular address if we type the masai school how will I 
know how will the system know what is the IP address of the masai 
school there might be some intermediate person which convert the 
human language and the IP address that we want to find and then 
using the IP addresses basically handshake will be possible and 
then we get the response. the internal person is DNS(Domain Name 
System) then IP addresses will be established and then the TCP handshake
will be established and then we will get the response
