<!--
DOM: Document Object Model
Document is linked with the Root element<html>

this root element is divided into two types:
Element<head> related with Element<title> related with Text"My Text"

Element<body> is related with Element<h1> and element<p>
element<h1> related with text"My Header"
element<p> related with Text"My Paragraph"

to write the javascript inside the html code we need to 
use the script tag like 
<script></script>
-->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>DOM</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Welcome to DOM</h1>
    </body>
</html>

<script>
    /*to view this in the html page go to inspect and then 
    select the console tab which shows the line of this console.log
    is present*/
    console.log("This is present in the script tag of HTML page.");
    console.log(document.title);
    console.log(document.head);
    /*Which shows the like alert, atob etc which also have the
    document, title: "DOM" which is the key value pair*/
    console.log(window);
    console.log(document);
</script>
